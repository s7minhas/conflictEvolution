## Replication instructions for the paper

The replication archive is organized into two directories (note that these files are also available on Github at [https://github/s7minhas/conflictEvolution](https://github.com/s7minhas/conflictEvolution)):

- **main**: contains the data files and scripts necessary to reproduce the main results in the paper
- **appendix**: contains the data files and scripts necessary to reproduce the results in the appendix

Replicating the figures and tables in the **main** text will take only a few minutes on a standard laptop if the provided `.rda` files are used.  

#### Setup information

All of the analyses reported in the manuscript and the appendix are run with the following specification (further information on packages used in the analysis is included at the end of the README): 

```
R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)
Running under: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6

Matrix products: default
BLAS: /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib
LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib

locale:
[1] C

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     

loaded via a namespace (and not attached):
[1] compiler_3.5.0
```

#### Running the scripts

Scripts should be run in the following order (each script assumes that the working directory matches the directory in which the script is stored): 

- **figure2.R**: Creates longitudinal, spatial visualization of conflict and stores resulting figure in `main/floats/figure2.pdf`.
- **figure3.R**: Creates network visualization of conflict in Nigeria from 2000-2016 and stores resulting figure in `main/floats/figure3.pdf`.
- **figure4.R**: Estimates parameters using AME in the paper and saves resulting model to `main/ameResults.rda`. Visualizations of model results are stored in `main/floats/figure4_top.pdf` and `main/floats/figure4_bottom.pdf`.
    + Original results from the authors are already included, if `main/ameResults.rda` is deleted, then this script will take approximately one hour to run. 
- **figure5.R**: Creates network visualization of conflict in Nigeria from 2000-2016 highlighting pre and post Boko Haram changes in relationships  and stores resulting figure in `main/floats/figure5.pdf`
- **figure6.R**: Visualizes additive sender/receiver effects from AME framework  and stores resulting figure in `main/floats/figure6.pdf`. For this script to run `main/ameResults.rda` must be present.
- **figure7.R**: Visualizes multiplicative effects from AME framework and stores resulting figure in `main/floats/figure7.pdf`. For this script to run `main/ameResults.rda` must be present.
- **figure8.R**: Conducts cross-validation to compare model performance and saves resulting model to `main/ameCrossValResults.rda` and `glmCrossValResults.rda`. Visualization of performance between AME and GLM models are stored in `main/floats/figure8a.pdf` and `main/floats/figure8b.pdf`. 
    + Original results from the authors are already included, if `main/ameCrossValResults.rda` is deleted, then this script will take approximately one hour to run assuming that the script is run in parallel using six cores.

We have also included all the analysis necessary to generate the results in the appendix. The appendix related scripts are labeled as `figureA[...].R` and `tableA1.R`. All the results from the appendix scripts will be stored in the `appendix/floats/` directory.

#### R package build notes

Below we provide the version of each of the libraries that our project relies on (each library was built using R 3.5.0). Additionally, please note that we use a tailored version of [Peter Hoff's AMEN package](http://pdhoff.github.io/amen/). Installing the version of AMEN that is used in this paper can be done  with the `devtools` package by running the following command in an R session: `devtools::install_github('s7minhas/amen', ref='pa2018_version')`.
