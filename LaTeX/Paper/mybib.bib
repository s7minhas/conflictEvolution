	(b) unjust; and (c) inflicted by significantly more powerful others,
	including 'complicit' civilians, with whom members of the strained
	collectivity have weak ties. These collective strains increase the
	likelihood of terrorism for several reasons, but they do not lead
	to terrorism in all cases-a range of factors condition their effect.}}

	network of sociopolitical causes. Yet this choice of action corresponds
	to another form of social violence. As psychologists, we can try
	to explain the consequences of terrorism, the reasons why terrorist
	groups always seem able to recruit new people for their purpose.
	It is also, perhaps, the link between these two issues which is even
	more interesting to explain. This paper offers a short review of
	past and contemporary hypotheses and research on terrorism in the
	field of psychology. More generally, this review considers international
	terrorism mainly perpetrated by radical Islamist fundamentalists.
	We will focus here on recent studies proposing that identity and,
	more specifically, social identity could be important factors in
	terrorism. Within these studies or reports, some point out the importance
	in contemporary terrorism of the threat that Western countries impute
	to Muslim and Arab identity As a conclusion, and in line with other
	authors, we introduce an integrative analysis framework for a vicious
	terror circle which begins with fear and threat, leads to the derogation
	of Muslim population in Western countries, and produces a fertile
	ground for the recruitment of terrorist sympathizers.}}

	militant Islam as a guide, we posit how and why various household
	attributes should affect a household member to grant or refuse permission
	for another household member to wage jihad. We then test our hypotheses
	implied by our argument using data on households' financial, religious,
	and social characteristics. We conclude that a number of social,
	economic, and religious factors account for variation in household
	members' support of jihad.}}

	turns out not to be recruiting suicide attackers; there is a rational
	basis for volunteering. Rather, the barrier is the danger of other
	operatives defecting. A club model, portraying voluntary religious
	organizations as efficient providers of local public goods, explains
	how they weed out potential defectors by requiring sacrifices as
	signals of commitment. They are thereby able to succeed in risky
	terrorist attacks. The model has testable implications for tactic
	choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebel organizations.
	Data spanning a half-century on both terrorists and civil war insurgents,
	much from Middle East sources and Israel/Palestine, reveal that:
	a) missions organized by radical religious clubs that provide benign
	local public goods are both more lethal and are more likely to be
	suicide attacks than missions organized by other terrorist groups
	with similar aims and theologies; and b) suicide attacks are chosen
	when targets are "hard," i.e., difficult to destroy. Our results
	suggest benign tactics to counter radical religious terrorism and

	Annote = {Byman discusses the targeted killing of Hamas leader Saleh Shehada
	and the general Israeli policy of targeted killing. He suggests that
	Israel's policy has essentially lead to an escalating tit-for-tat
	interaction as terrorist groups respond to the killings with more
	suicide attacks. Byman claims that the targeted killings perpetrated
	by Israel demonstrate that this tactic is less effective on decentralized
	groups. Thus, terrorist groups in Palestine have adjusted to the
	attacks by becoming more decentralized. Furthermore, such killings
	create martyrs, increase legitimacy for the terrorists' cause, and
	undermine the peace process. However, the policy continues because
	Israel believes the benefits outweigh the costs: the killings boost
	public opinion/morale, while retaliatory attacks may occur, attacks
	over all decrease and the sophistication of these attacks is in decline.
	
	
	Despite any of these advantages, Byman argues, the US should not be
	quick to adopt the use of targeted killings. Firstly, there is a
	US ban on assassination that makes this tactic one built on difficult
	and murky legal territory. Secondly, encouraging the targeted killing
	of other world leaders only encourages the assassination of our own.
	Third, because targeted killings are not widely accepted as a ``legitimate
	instrument of the state'' the US risks its reputation. Lastly, the
	use of targeted killings is much more difficult for the US because
	they face a global threat, not one in a neighboring state. In order
	to use targeted killings as effectively as Israel has the US would
	need to maintain a huge intelligence presence throughout the Middle
	East, Central Asia, and Europe.

	argue otherwise. This paper distinguishes three different senses
	of irrationality: unresponsiveness to incentives, deviation from
	narrow self-interest, and failure of rational expectations. It concludes
	that an intermediate position on the rationality of terrorism is
	appropriate. The typical terrorist sympathizer deviates only slightly
	from homo economicus. But active terrorists arguably stray from narrow
	self-interest and rational expectations, and suicidal terrorists
	probably violate both. Deterrence remains a viable anti-terrorism
	strategy, but deviations from rational expectations increase the

	increased the tendency to value outgroup violence more than ingroup
	violence increased, as did the tendencies to engage in more external

	that relative to guilt-prone group members who were instructed. to

	We argue that the assumptions of general violence prediction models,
	used in risk assessment procedures with other offenders, do not necessarily
	apply to terrorist offenders. Subsequently we discuss the assumption
	of general expertise in mental health professionals in such cases.
	Furthermore, we describe the role of professionals in this field,
	their expertise, and the use of psychological and psychiatric evidence.
	We are particularly concerned about the use of psychometric testing.
	Finally we make some recommendations about the approach to be used
	and the expertise required in assessing risk in politically motivated
	offenders.}}

	Annote = {This article investigates the extent to which the assassination of
	a head of state specifically affects political stability through
	an analysis of all assassinations of heads of state between 1952
	and 1997. The authors theorize that the resulting levels of instability
	following an assassination are conditional on the type of state institutions
	preexisting the assassination event. They find that those states,
	which lack a regularized means of leadership succession, experience
	higher levels of instability following an assassination attack. Conversely,
	states that have preexisting, regularized mechanisms for leadership,
	levels of instability following an attack actually decline. 
	
	Insight for our paper---what kind of leadership replacement system
	do insurgent groups have? If they have a high number of recruits,
	and leaders are easily/swiftly replaced in an organized and streamlined
	manner, then the implication that would follow from findings about
	states is that insurgent networks are immune to these attacks.

Jordan investigates the effectiveness of leadership decapitation on terrorist groups by assessing the duration of the organization and its tactical capacity following an attack. Using an original data set (1945-2000) Jordan uses measures of group size, age, and organization type as her independent variables and argues that ideological organizations are weaker following decapitation than are religious ones, and younger and smaller organizations are more likely to cease activity following the targeted killing of leader (she measures her DV, effectiveness, in two ways: firstly by group collapse/lifespan and secondly the group's capacity to carry out future attacks following the decapitation). She claims that leadership decapitation is an ineffective counterterrorism strategy because it does not increase the likelihood of the group's collapse. -Can't specifically at whether number of members increases (back lash recruitment) -Predicts individual head leader matters more than upper echelon members. But does quantity matter? Does she account for variation in number of leaders killed?},

	Abstract = {This article discusses how endogenous mechanisms linking processes
	of violent conflict and the economic well-being of individuals and
	households in combat areas provide valuable micro foundations to
	the ongoing debate on the causes and duration of armed conflict.
	Notably, the endogenous relationship between conflict processes and
	household economic status leads to the emergence of symbiotic associations
	between armed groups and households living in areas they control
	that affect substantially the probability of a conflict starting
	and its effectiveness thereafter. Households in conflict areas draw
	on local armed groups to protect their economic status when anticipating
	violence and during the conflict, while armed groups make use of
	different levels of (either reluctant or voluntary) participation,
	support and cooperation from local populations to advance their strategic
	objectives at the onset and throughout the conflict. The level of
	household participation at the start and during the conflict is a
	function of two interdependent variables, namely household vulnerability
	to poverty and household vulnerability to violence. The poorer the
	household is at the start of the conflict, the higher is the probability
	of the household participating and supporting an armed group. The
	higher the risk of violence, the higher is the probability of the
	household participating and supporting armed groups. The interaction
	between these two variables varies with the conflict itself and is
	defined by the direct and indirect effects of conflict-induced violence
	on the economic behaviour and decisions of households in combat areas.}}

	powers. Count models for 143 pairs of countries were used to estimate
	the effect of public opinion on terrorist incidents, controlling

	Abstract = {Two psychological perspectives on terrorism are distinguished, approaching
	it as a "syndrome'' and as a "tool,'' respectively. According to
	the "syndrome'' view, terrorism represents a psychologically meaningful
	construct with identifiable characteristics on individual and group
	levels of analysis. According to the "tool'' perspective, terrorism
	represents a strategic instrument that any party in a conflict with

	"syndrome'' view. Terrorists do not seem to be characterized by a
	unique set of psychological traits or pathologies. Nor has research
	uncovered any particular "root causes'' of terrorism. The vast heterogeneity
	of terrorism's users is consistent with the "tool'' view, affording
	an analysis of terrorism in terms of means-ends psychology. The "tool''
	view implies conditions under which potential perpetrators may find
	terrorism more or less appealing, hence offering guidance for the
	"war on terrorism.''}}

	aided by social and legal studies. In this review, we examine research
	oil the causes of terrorism and the effectiveness of strategies for
	countering it. We define terrorism as the threatened or actual use
	of illegal force directed against civilian targets by nonstate actors
	in order to attain a political goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.
	Our review of causes is divided by level of analysis into sections
	on individual-, group-, and macro-level explanations. Our evaluation
	of counterterrorism strategies includes reviews of legal, criminal
	justice, military, and legitimacy campaigns. Psychopathological approaches
	have been largely discredited; however, evidence suggests that certain
	experiences, attitudes, and behaviors are overrepresented among terrorists.
	The potential impact of ideology, leadership, Popular support, Diasporic
	communities, and socialization on group dynamics all provide fertile
	areas for additional research. Terrorism feeds on the ability of
	groups to portray governments and their agents as illegitimate. There
	is also evidence for high rates of terrorism in countries that are
	in democratic transition or are described as failed state!;. Research
	on connections between religious motives and terrorism is mixed.
	Although research on the efficacy of counterterrorism methods has
	grown rapidly in recent)fears, it is still rarely evaluated with
	strong empirical methods. All of these conclusions are qualified
	by the fact that both individual- and group-level empirical data
	on terrorism are in short supply.}}

	harm against it as morally outrageous, (2) the extent of humiliation
	the harmed state feels, and (3) the degree to which international

	affects the likelihood of revolt. This paper takes an approach different
	from previous studies by introducing data derived from two surveys
	of revolutionary preferences across a quarter-million randomly sampled
	individuals. More people are found to have a preference for revolt
	when inequality in their nation is high. A 1-standard-deviation increase
	in the Gini coefficient explains up to 38 percent of the standard
	deviation in revolutionary support. The results hold after controlling
	for a set of personal characteristics and country and year fixed
	effects. Since higher levels of income are found to have a negative
	impact on the taste for revolt, the results suggest that either "going
	for growth" or implementing policies that reduce inequality can buy
	off those individuals with revolutionary preferences.}}

	are most likely to volunteer to join the terrorist organization.
	However, the terrorist organization screens the volunteers for quality.
	Consequently, the model is consistent with two seemingly contradictory
	empirical findings. Actual terrorist operatives are not poor or lacking
	in education. And yet lack of economic opportunity and recessionary
	economies are positively correlated with terrorism. The model also
	endogenizes the effect of government counterterrorism on mobilization.
	Government crackdowns have competing effects on mobilization: they
	decrease the ability of terrorists to carry out effective attacks
	(making mobilization less attractive), and they foment ideological
	opposition to the government and impose negative economic externalities
	(making mobilization more attractive). This provides conditions under
	which government crackdowns increase or decrease mobilization.}}

	to the "globalization of martyrdom": al-Qaida's evolution into a
	global terrorist actor and the growing appeal of its guiding ideology,
	Salafi jihad. As localized patterns of suicide missions have given
	way to more globalized patterns, states must rethink their counterterrorism
	strategies. At the same time, because Salafi. jihadist groups tend
	to target Muslims, moderate Muslims and nonviolent Salafists must
	take the lead in challenging these groups.}}

	by taking account of the reasoning of the terrorist-organization
	leader as well as the reasoning of the individual terrorist. This
	allows us to observe the influence of the leader on the individual
	terrorist. Furthermore, we distinguish different motives that influence
	the individual agents activities. More precisely, we consider terrorist
	support as an impure public good generating different characteristics.
	Moreover, we allow the leader to influence the individual terrorists
	activities via different technologies; and finally, we take account
	of the fact that individual terrorists may develop a strong feeling
	of belongingness to the organization. In our framework, it is possible
	to explain why rational terrorists support terrorism and even commit
	suicide attacks. In line with empirical findings, income levels play
	no decisive factor in terrorists readiness to commit such attacks.}}

	or codal (e.g., madrassas; Wahhabism). The aim here is to outline
	an agenda which transitions discourse related to the "body" of the
	terrorist (i.e., his/her historical and social positioning) to one
	focused on intrapsychic and interpersonal emotional processes. As
	such, scholarship's predictive and explanatory capacities will be
	heightened if it adopts a perspective grounded in the emotions of
	terrorists and their source communities, particularly for those phenomena
	that suggest a fluidity of movement of actors across a continuum
	of zealotry. Criminology and criminal justice are well suited to
	assess the expressive byproducts of humiliated fury, contempt. moral
	outrage, and disgust and how such emotions may distillate as impulses
	that form a basis for terror. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}}

	strategies, evaluating the returns from alternative forms of international

	security agenda, yet there is almost no systematic evidence about
	why individual Pakistanis support Islamist militant organizations.
	An analysis of data from a nationally representative survey of urban
	Pakistanis refutes four influential conventional wisdoms about why
	Pakistanis support Islamic militancy. First, there is no clear relationship
	between poverty and support for militancy. If anything, support for
	militant organizations is increasing in terms of both subjective
	economic well-being and community economic performance. Second, personal
	religiosity and support for sharia law are poor predictors of support
	for Islamist militant organizations. Third, support for political
	goals espoused by legal Islamist parties is a weak indicator of support
	for militant organizations. Fourth, those who support core democratic
	principles or have faith in Pakistan's democratic process are not
	less supportive of militancy. Taken together, these results suggest
	that commonly prescribed solutions to Islamist militancy-economic
	development, democratization, and the like-may be irrelevant at best
	and might even be counterproductive.}}

	more conventional social science explanations, which include international
	anarchy, U.S. hegemony and presence in the Middle East, and culturally
	molded discourse sanctioning suicide terrorism in the Islamic context.
	Such a consilient approach, melding the explanatory power of the

	context of Islamic fundamentalist suicide terrorism, the motivation
	of suicide terrorists, and effective approaches to subvert this form
	of terrorism.}}

	Abstract = {This article reviews the state of the art of available theories and
	data regarding the psychology of terrorism. Data and theoretical
	material were gathered from the world's unclassified literature.
	Multiple theories and some demographic data have been published,
	but very few controlled empirical studies have been conducted investigating
	the psychological bases of terrorism. The field is largely characterized
	by theoretical speculation based on subjective interpretation of
	anecdotal observations. Moreover, most studies and theories fail
	to take into account the great heterogeneity of terrorists. Many
	practical, conceptual, and psychological barriers have slowed progress
	in this important field. Nonetheless, even at this early stage of
	terrorism studies, preliminary reports suggest that modifiable social
	and psychological factors contribute to the genesis of the terrorist
	mind-set. Psychological scholarship could possibly mitigate the risk
	of catastrophic attack by initiating the long overdue scientific
	study of terrorist mentalities.}}

	Abstract = {This paper studies extremist behaviour, and its connection to authoritarianism.
	I divide extremists into two groups, leaders, who demand extremist
	acts such as assassinations, suicide terror or other forms of political
	violence from followers, who supply them. I assume that both the
	leaders of extremist groups and their followers are rational. The
	paper looks at three examples: Communism, Nationalism and Islamic
	Fundamentalism. I show that leaders with extreme ideologies also
	tend to adopt violent methods when there is an indivisibility between
	the intermediate goal of the group and its ultimate goal. Turning
	to followers, the most important innovation of the paper is a simple
	model which explains how it is possible for a person to rationally
	commit suicide to further the goals of a group. The most important
	policy implications of the paper are, firstly, that one should look
	at the goals of extremist group in order to understand their actions.
	If one can un-bundle the goal or make the indivisible divisible,
	then there may be ways to provide these goals in a way which satisfies
	some of the potential supporters of the group and thus dries up support
	for the grander ambitions of the leaders of extremist groups. Secondly,
	the provision of programs which foster social cohesion tends to dry
	up an important motive for extremist activity: the desire for solidarity.
	Thirdly, policy towards terrorists should combine the use of "carrot"
	and "stick". Finally, I argue that authoritarian regimes rather than
	democracies or totalitarian regimes are the most likely sources of
	suicide terror. So democracy is indeed part of the solution to the
	problem of suicide terrorism.}}

	In the case discussed, terrorist organization may attack a potential
	target or not, and it is a dilemma for government to choose enhancing
	or keeping defense. The government may detect explicit and implicit
	signals to make decision. The results show that the signaling game
	is effective in risk analysis for problems with contradictory and
	asymmetric information, and it discovers the various impacts of government's
	optimal response to the terrorists' action by discussing the equilibrium
	of this game.}}

	(b) unjust; and (c) inflicted by significantly more powerful others,
	including 'complicit' civilians, with whom members of the strained
	collectivity have weak ties. These collective strains increase the
	likelihood of terrorism for several reasons, but they do not lead
	to terrorism in all cases-a range of factors condition their effect.}}

	Abstract = {Terrorism as an act of violence involves a vast and multi-factorial
	network of sociopolitical causes. Yet this choice of action corresponds
	to another form of social violence. As psychologists, we can try
	to explain the consequences of terrorism, the reasons why terrorist
	groups always seem able to recruit new people for their purpose.
	It is also, perhaps, the link between these two issues which is even
	more interesting to explain. This paper offers a short review of
	past and contemporary hypotheses and research on terrorism in the
	field of psychology. More generally, this review considers international
	terrorism mainly perpetrated by radical Islamist fundamentalists.
	We will focus here on recent studies proposing that identity and,
	more specifically, social identity could be important factors in
	terrorism. Within these studies or reports, some point out the importance
	in contemporary terrorism of the threat that Western countries impute
	to Muslim and Arab identity As a conclusion, and in line with other
	authors, we introduce an integrative analysis framework for a vicious
	terror circle which begins with fear and threat, leads to the derogation
	of Muslim population in Western countries, and produces a fertile
	ground for the recruitment of terrorist sympathizers.}}

	or refuse consent for other household members to become a militant
	(or mujahid). Using data derived from a detailed survey fielded among
	a convenience sample of 141 families of slain militants in Pakistan,
	this manuscript seeks to explain why some families support participation
	in jihad and why some families do not. Using the extant literature
	on recruitment, participation in violent political conflict, and
	militant Islam as a guide, we posit how and why various household
	attributes should affect a household member to grant or refuse permission
	for another household member to wage jihad. We then test our hypotheses
	implied by our argument using data on households' financial, religious,
	and social characteristics. We conclude that a number of social,
	economic, and religious factors account for variation in household
	members' support of jihad.}}

	Abstract = {Can rational models, once theological explanations are discredited,
	explain why certain radical religious rebels are so successful in
	perpetrating suicide attacks? The fundamental barrier to success
	turns out not to be recruiting suicide attackers; there is a rational
	basis for volunteering. Rather, the barrier is the danger of other
	operatives defecting. A club model, portraying voluntary religious
	organizations as efficient providers of local public goods, explains
	how they weed out potential defectors by requiring sacrifices as
	signals of commitment. They are thereby able to succeed in risky
	terrorist attacks. The model has testable implications for tactic
	choice and damage achieved by clubs and other rebel organizations.
	Data spanning a half-century on both terrorists and civil war insurgents,
	much from Middle East sources and Israel/Palestine, reveal that:
	a) missions organized by radical religious clubs that provide benign
	local public goods are both more lethal and are more likely to be
	suicide attacks than missions organized by other terrorist groups
	with similar aims and theologies; and b) suicide attacks are chosen
	when targets are "hard," i.e., difficult to destroy. Our results
	suggest benign tactics to counter radical religious terrorism and
	insurgency. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}}

	Year = {2006},
	Annote = {Byman discusses the targeted killing of Hamas leader Saleh Shehada
	and the general Israeli policy of targeted killing. He suggests that
	Israel's policy has essentially lead to an escalating tit-for-tat
	interaction as terrorist groups respond to the killings with more
	suicide attacks. Byman claims that the targeted killings perpetrated
	by Israel demonstrate that this tactic is less effective on decentralized
	groups. Thus, terrorist groups in Palestine have adjusted to the
	attacks by becoming more decentralized. Furthermore, such killings
	create martyrs, increase legitimacy for the terrorists' cause, and
	undermine the peace process. However, the policy continues because
	Israel believes the benefits outweigh the costs: the killings boost
	public opinion/morale, while retaliatory attacks may occur, attacks
	over all decrease and the sophistication of these attacks is in decline.
	
	
	Despite any of these advantages, Byman argues, the US should not be
	quick to adopt the use of targeted killings. Firstly, there is a
	US ban on assassination that makes this tactic one built on difficult
	and murky legal territory. Secondly, encouraging the targeted killing
	of other world leaders only encourages the assassination of our own.
	Third, because targeted killings are not widely accepted as a ``legitimate
	instrument of the state'' the US risks its reputation. Lastly, the
	use of targeted killings is much more difficult for the US because
	they face a global threat, not one in a neighboring state. In order
	to use targeted killings as effectively as Israel has the US would
	need to maintain a huge intelligence presence throughout the Middle
	East, Central Asia, and Europe.

	argue otherwise. This paper distinguishes three different senses
	of irrationality: unresponsiveness to incentives, deviation from
	narrow self-interest, and failure of rational expectations. It concludes
	that an intermediate position on the rationality of terrorism is
	appropriate. The typical terrorist sympathizer deviates only slightly
	from homo economicus. But active terrorists arguably stray from narrow
	self-interest and rational expectations, and suicidal terrorists
	probably violate both. Deterrence remains a viable anti-terrorism
	strategy, but deviations from rational expectations increase the
	potential of persuasion and appeasement.}}

	among individuals convicted of politically motivated violence - terrorism.
	We argue that the assumptions of general violence prediction models,
	used in risk assessment procedures with other offenders, do not necessarily
	apply to terrorist offenders. Subsequently we discuss the assumption
	of general expertise in mental health professionals in such cases.
	Furthermore, we describe the role of professionals in this field,
	their expertise, and the use of psychological and psychiatric evidence.
	We are particularly concerned about the use of psychometric testing.
	Finally we make some recommendations about the approach to be used
	and the expertise required in assessing risk in politically motivated
	offenders.}}

	to which volunteers sign up in the expectation of probabilistic earthly
	rewards. Contract enforcement is ensured by a sufficiently strong
	stigma, or social sanction, placed on renegades. The main implication
	for counterterrorism policy is that the sanction should be softened,

	a head of state specifically affects political stability through
	an analysis of all assassinations of heads of state between 1952
	and 1997. The authors theorize that the resulting levels of instability
	following an assassination are conditional on the type of state institutions
	preexisting the assassination event. They find that those states,
	which lack a regularized means of leadership succession, experience
	higher levels of instability following an assassination attack. Conversely,
	states that have preexisting, regularized mechanisms for leadership,
	levels of instability following an attack actually decline. 
	
	Insight for our paper---what kind of leadership replacement system
	do insurgent groups have? If they have a high number of recruits,
	and leaders are easily/swiftly replaced in an organized and streamlined
	manner, then the implication that would follow from findings about
	states is that insurgent networks are immune to these attacks.

She claims that leadership decapitation is an ineffective counterterrorism strategy because it does not increase the likelihood of the group's collapse. -Can't specifically at whether number of members increases (back lash recruitment) -Predicts individual head leader matters more than upper echelon members.

	Abstract = {This article discusses how endogenous mechanisms linking processes
	of violent conflict and the economic well-being of individuals and
	households in combat areas provide valuable micro foundations to
	the ongoing debate on the causes and duration of armed conflict.
	Notably, the endogenous relationship between conflict processes and
	household economic status leads to the emergence of symbiotic associations
	between armed groups and households living in areas they control
	that affect substantially the probability of a conflict starting
	and its effectiveness thereafter. Households in conflict areas draw
	on local armed groups to protect their economic status when anticipating
	violence and during the conflict, while armed groups make use of
	different levels of (either reluctant or voluntary) participation,
	support and cooperation from local populations to advance their strategic
	objectives at the onset and throughout the conflict. The level of
	household participation at the start and during the conflict is a
	function of two interdependent variables, namely household vulnerability
	to poverty and household vulnerability to violence. The poorer the
	household is at the start of the conflict, the higher is the probability
	of the household participating and supporting an armed group. The
	higher the risk of violence, the higher is the probability of the
	household participating and supporting armed groups. The interaction
	between these two variables varies with the conflict itself and is
	defined by the direct and indirect effects of conflict-induced violence
	on the economic behaviour and decisions of households in combat areas.}}

	the "syndrome'' view, terrorism represents a psychologically meaningful

	represents a strategic instrument that any party in a conflict with
	another may use. Research thus far has found little support for the

	uncovered any particular "root causes'' of terrorism. The vast heterogeneity
	of terrorism's users is consistent with the "tool'' view, affording
	an analysis of terrorism in terms of means-ends psychology. The "tool''
	view implies conditions under which potential perpetrators may find
	terrorism more or less appealing, hence offering guidance for the
	"war on terrorism.''}}

	aided by social and legal studies. In this review, we examine research
	oil the causes of terrorism and the effectiveness of strategies for
	countering it. We define terrorism as the threatened or actual use
	of illegal force directed against civilian targets by nonstate actors
	in order to attain a political goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.
	Our review of causes is divided by level of analysis into sections
	on individual-, group-, and macro-level explanations. Our evaluation
	of counterterrorism strategies includes reviews of legal, criminal
	justice, military, and legitimacy campaigns. Psychopathological approaches
	have been largely discredited; however, evidence suggests that certain
	experiences, attitudes, and behaviors are overrepresented among terrorists.
	The potential impact of ideology, leadership, Popular support, Diasporic
	communities, and socialization on group dynamics all provide fertile
	areas for additional research. Terrorism feeds on the ability of
	groups to portray governments and their agents as illegitimate. There
	is also evidence for high rates of terrorism in countries that are
	in democratic transition or are described as failed state!;. Research
	on connections between religious motives and terrorism is mixed.
	Although research on the efficacy of counterterrorism methods has
	grown rapidly in recent)fears, it is still rarely evaluated with
	strong empirical methods. All of these conclusions are qualified
	by the fact that both individual- and group-level empirical data
	on terrorism are in short supply.}}

	harm against it as morally outrageous, (2) the extent of humiliation
	the harmed state feels, and (3) the degree to which international
	retaliation is institutionalized by rules and laws that govern the
	use of cross-border force. We examine the Second Lebanon War (July
	2006) as a case of revenge in international politics.}}

	affects the likelihood of revolt. This paper takes an approach different
	from previous studies by introducing data derived from two surveys
	of revolutionary preferences across a quarter-million randomly sampled
	individuals. More people are found to have a preference for revolt
	when inequality in their nation is high. A 1-standard-deviation increase
	in the Gini coefficient explains up to 38 percent of the standard
	deviation in revolutionary support. The results hold after controlling
	for a set of personal characteristics and country and year fixed
	effects. Since higher levels of income are found to have a negative
	impact on the taste for revolt, the results suggest that either "going
	for growth" or implementing policies that reduce inequality can buy
	off those individuals with revolutionary preferences.}}

	of an endogenous choice, individuals with low ability or little education
	are most likely to volunteer to join the terrorist organization.
	However, the terrorist organization screens the volunteers for quality.
	Consequently, the model is consistent with two seemingly contradictory
	empirical findings. Actual terrorist operatives are not poor or lacking
	in education. And yet lack of economic opportunity and recessionary
	economies are positively correlated with terrorism. The model also
	endogenizes the effect of government counterterrorism on mobilization.
	Government crackdowns have competing effects on mobilization: they
	decrease the ability of terrorists to carry out effective attacks
	(making mobilization less attractive), and they foment ideological
	opposition to the government and impose negative economic externalities
	(making mobilization more attractive). This provides conditions under
	which government crackdowns increase or decrease mobilization.}}

	through March 2008, suggests that two interrelated factors have contributed
	to the "globalization of martyrdom": al-Qaida's evolution into a
	global terrorist actor and the growing appeal of its guiding ideology,
	Salafi jihad. As localized patterns of suicide missions have given
	way to more globalized patterns, states must rethink their counterterrorism
	strategies. At the same time, because Salafi. jihadist groups tend
	to target Muslims, moderate Muslims and nonviolent Salafists must
	take the lead in challenging these groups.}}

	allows us to observe the influence of the leader on the individual

	the individual agents activities. More precisely, we consider terrorist
	support as an impure public good generating different characteristics.
	Moreover, we allow the leader to influence the individual terrorists
	activities via different technologies; and finally, we take account
	of the fact that individual terrorists may develop a strong feeling
	of belongingness to the organization. In our framework, it is possible
	to explain why rational terrorists support terrorism and even commit
	suicide attacks. In line with empirical findings, income levels play
	no decisive factor in terrorists readiness to commit such attacks.}}

	or codal (e.g., madrassas; Wahhabism). The aim here is to outline
	an agenda which transitions discourse related to the "body" of the
	terrorist (i.e., his/her historical and social positioning) to one
	focused on intrapsychic and interpersonal emotional processes. As
	such, scholarship's predictive and explanatory capacities will be
	heightened if it adopts a perspective grounded in the emotions of
	terrorists and their source communities, particularly for those phenomena
	that suggest a fluidity of movement of actors across a continuum
	of zealotry. Criminology and criminal justice are well suited to
	assess the expressive byproducts of humiliated fury, contempt. moral
	outrage, and disgust and how such emotions may distillate as impulses
	that form a basis for terror. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}}

	religious or cultural principles, a social identity based in sharp
	contrasts between one's own group and groups perceived as threats,
	and a foreclosed and authoritarian sense of personal identity or,
	less often, a diffused and aimless personal identity. Examples from
	religious-extremist and ethnic conflicts in which terrorism has been
	employed are used to illustrate the tenets advanced here. Recommendations
	for addressing and preventing the threat of terrorism are discussed.}}

	why individual Pakistanis support Islamist militant organizations.
	An analysis of data from a nationally representative survey of urban
	Pakistanis refutes four influential conventional wisdoms about why
	Pakistanis support Islamic militancy. First, there is no clear relationship
	between poverty and support for militancy. If anything, support for
	militant organizations is increasing in terms of both subjective
	economic well-being and community economic performance. Second, personal
	religiosity and support for sharia law are poor predictors of support
	for Islamist militant organizations. Third, support for political
	goals espoused by legal Islamist parties is a weak indicator of support
	for militant organizations. Fourth, those who support core democratic
	principles or have faith in Pakistan's democratic process are not
	less supportive of militancy. Taken together, these results suggest
	that commonly prescribed solutions to Islamist militancy-economic
	development, democratization, and the like-may be irrelevant at best
	and might even be counterproductive.}}

	of marriage markets delaying marriage for young adult men in the

	unexplored in the social sciences, despite their presumptive application

	more conventional social science explanations, which include international
	anarchy, U.S. hegemony and presence in the Middle East, and culturally
	molded discourse sanctioning suicide terrorism in the Islamic context.
	Such a consilient approach, melding the explanatory power of the

	context of Islamic fundamentalist suicide terrorism, the motivation
	of suicide terrorists, and effective approaches to subvert this form
	of terrorism.}}

	Multiple theories and some demographic data have been published,

	by theoretical speculation based on subjective interpretation of
	anecdotal observations. Moreover, most studies and theories fail

	practical, conceptual, and psychological barriers have slowed progress
	in this important field. Nonetheless, even at this early stage of
	terrorism studies, preliminary reports suggest that modifiable social
	and psychological factors contribute to the genesis of the terrorist
	mind-set. Psychological scholarship could possibly mitigate the risk
	of catastrophic attack by initiating the long overdue scientific

	Abstract = {This paper studies extremist behaviour, and its connection to authoritarianism.
	I divide extremists into two groups, leaders, who demand extremist
	acts such as assassinations, suicide terror or other forms of political
	violence from followers, who supply them. I assume that both the
	leaders of extremist groups and their followers are rational. The
	paper looks at three examples: Communism, Nationalism and Islamic
	Fundamentalism. I show that leaders with extreme ideologies also
	tend to adopt violent methods when there is an indivisibility between
	the intermediate goal of the group and its ultimate goal. Turning
	to followers, the most important innovation of the paper is a simple
	model which explains how it is possible for a person to rationally
	commit suicide to further the goals of a group. The most important
	policy implications of the paper are, firstly, that one should look
	at the goals of extremist group in order to understand their actions.
	If one can un-bundle the goal or make the indivisible divisible,
	then there may be ways to provide these goals in a way which satisfies
	some of the potential supporters of the group and thus dries up support
	for the grander ambitions of the leaders of extremist groups. Secondly,
	the provision of programs which foster social cohesion tends to dry
	up an important motive for extremist activity: the desire for solidarity.
	Thirdly, policy towards terrorists should combine the use of "carrot"
	and "stick". Finally, I argue that authoritarian regimes rather than
	democracies or totalitarian regimes are the most likely sources of
	suicide terror. So democracy is indeed part of the solution to the
	problem of suicide terrorism.}}

	between terrorist organization and government in a "terrorism game".
	In the case discussed, terrorist organization may attack a potential
	target or not, and it is a dilemma for government to choose enhancing
	or keeping defense. The government may detect explicit and implicit
	signals to make decision. The results show that the signaling game
	is effective in risk analysis for problems with contradictory and
	asymmetric information, and it discovers the various impacts of government's
	optimal response to the terrorists' action by discussing the equilibrium
	of this game.}}
