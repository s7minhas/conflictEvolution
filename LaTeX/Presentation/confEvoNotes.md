Thanks for giving me some time to speak, I'm currently just a postdoc at Duke and about to leave for Michigan State in a couple of months. Reason I'm in LA is that my advisor, Mike Ward, was nice enough to let me enjoy some sun before i head back home to the midwest.

My substantive interests in political science have roots in the conflict literature, and much of my time the past two years has been spent working with Peter Hoff and Mike on the development of network approaches that can be used to study problems of relevance to political science.

The work I'm presenting here is certainly influenced by that collaboration, but this is a joint project with a few of my old colleagues from Duke, Cassy Dorff and Max Gallop. Very broadly the goal of this paper is to argue that many modern day conflicts involve an array of actors that are interacting within a system. If we want to study systems such as these then we need to consider how interactions between these actors may be interdependent.

Also IN the presentation, I've tried to be mindful of the fact that I'm speaking to a diverse audience, so if it seems that I've assumed you know something that you dont just yell at me and I'll try to clarify. And In general, whenever you have a question or the urge to give a critique or correction feel free to just yell it out. So anyhow thanks for coming, I'm looking forward to getting some feedback on this project, and lets jump into it.

conflict studies
==

* We dont hear much about interstate wars anymore -- with some exceptions such as flare ups between countries like Pakistan and India. But what we often see in the news are references to civil wars -- these are wars that are taking place between government and insurgent groups within a country.

* In fact, since the end of world war 2 more than half of the countries in the international system have experienced a civil war, and intrastate conflicts are actually on the rise. These types of conflicts have proven to be costly, as violence between state and non-state actors has led to some of the highest yearly fatality counts in the post-Cold War period. To see evidence of this one just need to open a newspaper and read about events in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo or Syria.

* Now social scientists have taken particular note of intrastate conflicts. And the prevalence and costliness of this type of warfare has resulted in the development of a rich literature on the causes and consequences of civil war. Through the existing literature we have developed a better understanding of the links between:
  - economic performance and conflict,
  - civil and interstate conflict,
  - how civil wars can spillover into other countries
  - how certain types of political institutions can affect the risk of violence
  - and how ethnic divisions within a country can stir conflict

* The focus of much of this literature has been on understanding what type of countries are prone to civil war. Because of that focus the empirical design that they employ is the country-year. Where the goal of the analysis is to predict or understand why a particular country at a particular time experienced a civil conflict. Now this means that when much of the quantitative literature studies the emergence or termination of civil war we try to summarize the various events that are going on in that country in a given year into a single observation.

* This can obviously be somewhat problematic, and scholars in political science increasingly recognize this. Evidence of this realization is a 2009 special issue that came out at the Journal of Conflict Resolution that advocated and showed how we could move beyond these high level monadic studies and peer into civil wars from a dyadic perspective. What this typically means is that we look at some specified country or region and evaluate the likelihood of conflict between actors within that system.

* This was an incredibly important transition because by shifting to the dyadic level we are actually pointing our empirical models closer to where the action is actually taking place.

* Yet, much of this recent dyadic work has focused on just evaluating the relationship between a government on the one side and rebel groups on the other. This is certainly useful as it can help us to better understand how attributes of non-state actors and their relationship to the state can be used to understand how conflicts evolve or end.

conflicts are complex
==

* But those perspectives do not provide much consideration to the multi-actor dynamics that characterize recent examples of intrastate conflicts. This is a notable absence given that even by 2003 over 30\% of active civil wars involved multiple dyads in conflict with one another.

* For example, in the current Syrian civil war, Bashar al-Assad's government is fighting against the Islamic State and multiple militarized opposition groups (the Free Syrian Army, Jaysh al-Islam, Ahrar al-Sham and others). Each of these actors is often involved in conflict both with the government and amongst themselves.

* The graphic here provides a high level summary of the actors involved and the links between them in the syrian conflict. in the inner ring are actors such as isil and the syrian government, and the the outer ring is composed of external nations that have some involvement in the conflict.

* Though the Syrian conflict is extra complex because of the involvement of outside actors, the fact that modern day intrastate conflicts are complex extends to many other regions. For example, in Mexico, we observe drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) vying both for political influence and territorial control against government actors and other DTOs.  Complex systems of conflict dynamics such as those can be found in countries as varied as India, Colombia, and Nigeria.

* The fact that conflicts are complex is not a point lost on scholars in the field. Kathleen Cunningham notes that while qualitative studies have delved more into the complex dynamics between rebel groups, the quantitative literature has yet to do so to the same degree.

* Yet this is important, since states often face multiple challengers in what are essentially different civil wars (for example, see India’s multiple low-level wars).  Dyads in conflict with the same state are clearly not totally independent. To deal with the fact that dyads in conflict are not independent so far the literature has typically just addressed such issues using clustering standard errors.

* Systems of this sort have long been studied in other fields such as sociology, where researchers have argued that to understand an actor's (or group's) behavior it is necessary to understand the system in which the actor is enmeshed. Many of the questions that conflict scholars are interested in require a careful application of these lessons.
  - For example, can the actions of a particular actor lead to greater levels of violence between other actors in the system? How does a government crackdown on one group affect the activities of other challenger groups? Grappling with any of these questions requires developing a methodological approach in which we can account for dependencies between actors.

role of civilians
==

* Further reconceptualizing our understanding of civil conflict through a network perspective enables us to better understand a substantive topic that has gained increasing attention in the conflict literature in recent years. Specifically, the role that civilians play in shaping a conflict.

* Compared to the number of studies focusing on economic, political, and identity-based drivers of conflict, existing research is only beginning to explore the role of civilians in conflict.

* Now civilians sustain substantial costs during a war. At the individual level, the civilian often faces the risk of death and physical abuse. At the collective level, civilian populations must navigate the destruction of roads, schools, hospitals, and basic infrastructure. But as scholars like Kalyvas note civilians are not merely passive victims of war, they can be a source of information for groups.

* Civilians have agency and, in many cases, organize against the violence that surrounds them. However, we argue that their role in a conflict is contingent on whether or not the system is composed of dyadic, independent conflicts or a multi-actor network.

focus
===

* So the contributions we hope to make can be summarized as such. First, we provide a consideration of the role that civilians play in multi-actor conflict environments. The argument that we will make is that in multi-actor conflicts civilians again become passive actors in a conflict.
* Second we suggest a way in which the study of civil conflict can be reframed in way that removes the assumption that dyads in the system are operating independently of one another. To do this we use a network based approach that enables us to not only examine the ways in which interactions between actors are interdependent but also still test how certain attributes of actors or the environment in general can affect the propensity for conflict.
* And last we apply these ideas to the study of the intrastate conflict system in nigeria.


Civilian victimization & conflict
===

* More often than not, analyses of armed conflict, civil war, and widespread criminal violence shine a spotlight on those actors that seek to wield power through collective violence against a given population or government. However, this narrative has begun to change. With uprisings across the last five years--the Tunisian revolution, the Egyptian revolution, the Syrian Civil War, and the 2014 protests in Venezuela--attention has shifted to recognize the potential power of the population to influence environments of extreme violence and repression.

* While there is a robust debate over what causes civilian victimization, discussion of the consequences of civilian victimization, particularly as they relate to the potential for future conflict has been more limited.

* And those that do discuss this issue do so with a focus on the rebel-government dyad. THe principal argument these scholars provide rests on the role that civilians can play as an information resource, specifically:

  when insurgents kill civilians, other civilians are more likely to share information with the government: information allows the government to carry out attacks against insurgents, and the lack of information going towards insurgents may deprive them of information they need to carry out attacks against the government
  thus actors will be wary of turning the civilian populous against them

* Condra and Shapiro (2012) find support for this relationship during the early stages of the war in Iraq. Areas where US-led coalition forces kill civilians are associated with a higher likelihood of future insurgent attacks, and areas where insurgent forces kill civilians are associated with a lower risk of future insurgent attacks (against the US-led coalition).

transition to network context
===

* When an armed group kills civilians in a multi-actor environment, the downsides of victimizing civilians diminish because the role of civilians as an information source diminishes.

* Consider the plight of civilians victimized by a violent rebel group. According to previous research on dyadic conflicts, civilians know the actors to rely on to obtain protection and revenge--the group that did not victimize them.

* In a multi-actor conflict, the choice to respond to victimization by informing on the perpetrators (or siding with their opponents) is less clear.
  - In this setting, civilians observe that the very existence of multiple challenger groups weakens the government.
  - Thus in a multiparty conflict, the government is less likely to be viewed as capable of effective civilian protection when fighting between rebel groups increase.
  - In addition, if a rebel group preys on civilians, civilians may not be able to safely identify or contact the victimizers' rival rebel group.

expectations for civilians
===

* our expectation is that groups which target civilians are not going to be any less likely to initiate more attacks in the future as the downsides they would typically incur for attacking civilians are mitigated.

* Thus when we reconsider intrastate conflict through this multi-actor lens, we may instead find that civilians do indeed once again become passive actors in a conflict.

from dyads to networks
===

* now how do we test the effects of civilian victimization in a dyadic context.

* Dyadic data consists of a set of nodes, in our case these are rebel groups.

* And for pairs of these nodes we have some measurement, ie whether some battle occurred.

* Typically political scientists organize this data into large dyadic frames, in which we have senders down a column, receivers down another, and then the relation between the two. This typically makes for some very large datasets.

* Another way of organizing this information is in terms of an adjacency matrix. Here in the case of a directed network we have nodes listed as senders on the rows and receivers on the column. The cross-sections define the relation from i to j. And the diagonals are typically undefined since we dont consider actors as being able to send an action to themselves.

* And then last people like me always feel the need to take these adjacency matrices and try to make a network out of 'em.

dyadic data assumptions
===

* The reason for studying dyadic interactions using a network based approach is to acknowledge the possibility that the actions of actors in a system are contingent on one another.

* When using standard techniques such as GLM we assume a priori that the observed dyadic interactions are independent. By moving away from the assumption that interactions within a system are independent, a significant amount of work has shown that we can better account for the underlying process that generates relational data and make more accurate inferences.

* In recent years, however, there have been plenty of very interesting solutions to this issue that remain within the realm of GLM, ie Erikson et al suggest to employ randomization tests to infer the correct p-values associated with dyadic hypotheses.

* Aronow et al. came up with a non-parametric, sandwich-type robust variance estimator for linear regression to account for dyadic data that can even be applied to longitudinal data. And recently from econ Athey et al. also have posited a way to address this problem.

* And if one's research agenda is just focused on conducting hypothesis tests appropriately when estimating the effect of some exogenous variable on a relational dv, these tests might do just fine. With one caveat being that I'm not quite sure how well they do in the face of triadic dependence patterns.

* Further at times examining the role that higher order network patterns play in a network can be both theoretically interesting and useful accounting for those patterns has proven to be useful when it comes to prediction.

* The principal idea underlying each of the dependence patterns discussed above is that the actions, or inactions, of any actor, are taking place within an interdependent system.

now additive effects
===
* A particular reason for why interactions between actors may not be independent stems from the fact that in social systems we often observe heterogeneity in how central actors are to the activities occurring within the network, meaning that some may initiate and/or be the target of more events. Heterogeneity in the centrality of actors provides us with information on the set of events that led to the network as we observe it and for how the network will continue to evolve. Namely, the implication of heterogeneity in how active actors are in a network is within-actor homogeneity of ties, meaning that the relationships between the set of dyads $\{i \rightarrow j,\, i \rightarrow k,\, i \rightarrow l\}$ will be more similar to each other than they are to other interactions in the system, such as $m \rightarrow n$, because they all involve actor $i$ as the sender of the event \citep{kenny:lavoie:1984}.

* A straightforward example for why we may see this type of dependence emerge in intrastate conflict networks may involve government actors, who likely have interests in asserting their control across the country. Specifically, in a scenario where rebel groups $\{j,k,l\}$ are operating in different parts of a country, we would expect a government actor $i$ to be a more likely initiate of conflict with those rebel groups than an actor with non-competing interests. This logic can obviously extend to non-government groups as well. For example, a rebel group may be acting upon ambitions of establishing control over broad swaths of the country, and, as a result, it may become a more central initiator of conflicts in the network.

* For similar reasons we may observe heterogeneity in how likely actors are to receive conflict events, and, relatedly, we are likely to find that actors initiating more conflicts are likely to also face more conflicts, in general. Each of these effects relates to reasons why there may be dependence between the observations involving a particular actor.

###
The relevance of modeling nodal and dyadic dependencies has long been recognized within some social sciences particularly in psychology. (Warner et al., 1979) developed the foundational model for analyzing such within-node and within-dyad dependence is the social relations model, or SRM.

The goal of this model is to decompose the variance of observations in an adjacency matrix in terms of heterogeneity across row means (out-degree), heterogeneity along column means (in-degree), correlation between row and column means, and correlations within dyads. So basically all the stuff we've just been talking about.

This initially was developed as an ANOVA decomposition, but Li & Loken (2002) developed a normal random-eﬀects version of the SRM, which takes the form shown here:

The basic idea here is simple, µ provides a baseline measure of the density or sparsity of a network and then we begin to decompose the residual variation.

Specifically, the residual variation decomposes into parts: a row/sender eﬀect (a_i ), a column/receiver eﬀect (b_j ), and a within-dyad eﬀect, epsilon_ij.

The row and column eﬀects are modeled jointly from a multivariate normal to account for correlation in how active an actor is in sending and receiving ties.

Heterogeneity in the row and column means is captured by σ_a and σ_b, respectively, and σ_ab describes the linear relationship between these two eﬀects (i.e., whether actors who send [receive] a lot of ties also receive [send] a lot of ties).

Beyond these ﬁrst-order dependencies, second order dependencies are described by σ^2 and a within dyad correlation, or reciprocity, parameter ρ.
###

third order patterns
===
* Missing from the framework provided by the SRM is an accounting of third-order dependence patterns that can arise in relational data.

* For example, in a binary network where people prefer to form ties to others who are similar to them, there tend to be a lot of “transitive triples,” that is, triples of indices i, j, k having a link between each pair. One explanation of this is that links from i to j and from i to k occur because i is similar to both j and to k. If this is the case, then j and k must also be somewhat similar, and so there is a high probability of a link between j and k, which would form a triangle of ties among nodes i, j and k. Multiple linked triangles result in visual “clusters” in graphs of social networks. The left-most plot  provides a representation of a network that exhibits this type of pattern.

* In the intrastate setting, conflict triads may emerge when multiple actors are competing for control over the same territory or resource.

* Another third-order dependence pattern that cannot be accounted for in the additive effects framework is stochastic equivalence. A pair of actors $ij$ are stochastically equivalent if the probability of $i$ relating to, and being related to, by every other actor is the same as the probability for $j$. This refers to the idea that there will be groups of nodes in a network with similar relational patterns.

* Consider a case in which actors nest in groups based on, for example, a shared but unobserved ideology: $\mathbf{a}=\{i,j\}$ and $\mathbf{b}=\{k,l\}$. Here we may likely find that the relations of $i$ towards $k$ and $l$ is similar to how $j$ behaves towards those actors, and this induces a dependence in the relations of actors within the system. Specifically, the behavior of actors within the conflict system may be a function of a latent community to which they belong.

lfm
===

To account for third-order dependence patterns within the context of the SRRM we turn to latent variable models, which have become a popular approach for modeling relational data in fields as diverse as biology to computer science to the social sciences.

the latent factor model, each node i has an unknown latent factor. basically it looks like a factor model, the likelihood of a tie between two nodes is like the inner product of these latetn factors.  this is essentially an eigendecomposition of a latent space, every matrix has an eigendecomposition.
this is a very flexible model

nodes with similar factors can have a large or small probability of ties depending on if you positive or negative eigenvalues.

ame
===

the model that we will use in this paper is known as ame. it is composed of an additive and multiplicative effects component. i'll explain both in turn below.

peter has recently released a package that enables people to use this model, it is up on cran and called ame-n. the n comes from the fact that estimation relies on an mcmc routine, and once you have your model running you just start saying amen so the bayesian gods look down favorably and grant you convergence sooner.

nigeria
===

* To study the role of civilians and networks in intrastate conflict, we turn to the Nigerian case from 2000-2016.

* During these years, Nigeria has seen the rise of multiple armed non-state actor groups. In the southern delta region armed actors such as the Movement for the Emancipation of the Nigerian Delta (MEND) have battled the government for control of oil production.

* Boko Haram, potentially the most well known of these groups, has caused massive devastation both to human life and infrastructure in the Northern regions of the country. This group often targets Christian civilians via the bombing of schools, churches, and other community centers. Accordingly, Boko Haram has challenged the governments' ability to keep order and protect civilians.

* this case is useful for analysis due to its multi-party nature and the role that both civilian victimization and civilian mobilization have potentially played in shaping the conflict's development. By using a network approach, we are able to better understand and predict these dynamics in Nigeria.

nets
data

covariates
===

* More importantly, to examine the affect that Boko Haram's entrance has had on the level of conflict in this system we include a binary variable that takes on the value of one after the Boko Haram insurgency has begun (in 2009) and zero beforehand.\footnote{We choose this date both because 2009 is considered the beginning of the Boko Haram insurgency in most media reports, despite their founding in 2002, and because 2009 features the first battle including Boko Haram in the ACLED Dataset.}

* Second, a notable literature has developed explicating the mechanisms through which civil conflict can diffuse between countries. To account for this effect, we use the ACLED dataset to count the number of conflict events occurring within Nigeria's contiguous neighbors.

* we include a binary variable that is one if the following year is an election year and zero otherwise. This is to account for the fact that elections in Nigeria are rarely waged peacefully in the ballot box, but instead are typically followed or preceded by episodes of conflict.

* To understand the role that civilians play in shaping conflict within the Nigerian system we create two nodal level covariates.
  - we create a count of the number of violent actions that an actor committed against civilians at time $t-1$.
  - We create a count of the number of protests/riots led by civilians against a given actor at time $t-1$
* We include these nodal covariates to explain both the probability of an actor sending and receiving a conflictual tie.

* Last, we add in a measure of how dispersed a rebel group's activity is across the country. Armed groups whose actions are more dispersed across Nigeria are more likely to come into conflictual contact with others.\footnote{For example, to model $y_{ij,t}$, we calculate this by taking all the events involving group $i$ in the 3 years prior to $t$ and estimating the variance.} We include a ``Geographic Spread'' variable as both a sender and receiver covariate.

Random additive effects
===

* We depict the sender ($\hat{a}_{i}$) and receiver ($\hat{b}_{j}$) random effects in figure \ref{fig:abEst}. This figure shows which actors are more (and less) violent than would be predicted by just accounting for the exogenous covariates we reviewed in the previous section. We can see, for example, that Boko Haram actually has a random sender effect that is approximately zero, implying that once we account for their high tendency to target civilians and the secular increase in violence that followed their entry into the conflict the model is able to accurately predict the group's tendency towards initiating conflict. On the other hand actors like the Fulani and Hausa militias have notably positive sender and receiver effects (and the Christian and Muslim Militias have notably negative effects).

multiplicative effects
===

* Figure \ref{circplot} shows the directions of actors' latent factors for both sending, left panel, and receiving violence, right panel. The directions of $\hat{u}_{i}$'s (for sending conflict) and $\hat{v}_{i}$'s (for receiving conflict) are noted in \textcolor{blue}{blue} and \textcolor{red}{red}, respectively. The size of the label assigned to the points is a function of the magnitude of the vectors.\footnote{Figure \ref{netGOF} in the appendix summarizes how well we capture first, second, and third order dependencies using our model.} The purpose of this figure is to discern groups of actors that are more similar to each other in terms of whom they send conflict to (outer ring) or receive conflict from (inner ring). Actor similarity here results from third order dependence patterns -- specifically, homophily and stochastic equivalence -- that remain after accounting for the other parameters estimated by the model.
