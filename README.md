Abstract
---
Civil conﬂicts are complex: multiple warring parties compete for control of territory both against each other and the government. These processes are often dynamic; changing over time and space. In this study, we embrace these complexities through a network based approach. By considering important relational patterns, such as reciprocity and transitivity, and tying them together with existing theoretical developments in the conﬂict processes literature, we answer the question of ‘who ﬁghts whom and when’ during civil conﬂict. Further, using the case of Nigeria, we oﬀer novel theoretical insights about how the entrance of a new, aggressive actor can decisively alter the trajectory of conﬂict. In addition, we show that our approach is better at predicting ‘who ﬁghts whom and when’ in an out-of-sample context than extant approaches.
